# Music_Recommendation
A Machine Learning Project to recommend music Genres to new users in other to increase sales

# Data Prep.
We don't need to clean the data because it is okay. gender categories into (1,0) for (males and females)  
But we have to split the data into input and output to enable the model predict music for users who dont fall within the defined age ranges.

# Trainning
When trainnig your models always remember to feed your models with enough dataset for proper accuracy. in this example 80% was used for training while 20%(0.2) was used for testing.
